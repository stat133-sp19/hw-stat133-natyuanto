### Shot Charts

Below are shot charts for each players.

<img src="../images/gsw-shot-charts.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

First and foremost, we have *Andre Iguodala*'s shot chart at the top left corner. He is known as an NBA All-Star in 2012 and NBA All-Defensie Team twice. Based on the chart, he seems to prefer taking shots from the three-point area than from the two-point area. He has an equally distribution of red and blue spots all over the court which indicates that he has a fair share of good and bad shots.

To the right, we have *Draymond Green*'s shot chart. He is known as a three-time NBA champion and a three-time NBA All-Star. Looking at his shot chart, he seems to be equally likely in taking shots from the three-point area or from the two-point area. Though, he appear to have quite an amount of bad shots. Despite it, he has proven himselft to be an excellent defender for the Warriors as he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year title in 2017.

At the top right corner, we have *Kevin Durant*'s shot chart. Based on his chart, he certainly prefers to do shots in the two-point area as it is the most densely populated area. He has won numerous awards - from NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, to Olympic gold medals. He is also known as one of the highest-earning basketball players off the court in the world.

Credited as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history, we have *Klay Thompson*'s shot chart in the bottom left corner. He is a five-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Third Team honoree, and a three-time NBA champion. Based on his chart, he seems to do a lot of shots both in the three-point area and the two-point area, making him nicknamed as the "Splash Brothers."

Last but not least, as many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history, we have *Stephen Curry*'s shot chart at the bottom center. He is known to be a six-time NBA All-Star,the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice and has won three NBA championships with the Warriors. Also, he is the other brother in the "Splash Brothers", rewriting history with his three-point shots. However, comparing his chart to Klay Thompson's, he seems to ba a risk taker instead as some of his shots are way further than the three-point line.
