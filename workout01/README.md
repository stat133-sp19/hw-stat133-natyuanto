Workout 01: GSW Shot Charts

This homework is to allow us to:
        1) Work with a more complex file structure and uploading files to GitHub;
        2) Visualize shot data of NBA players, and producing “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations.
        3) Produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.
