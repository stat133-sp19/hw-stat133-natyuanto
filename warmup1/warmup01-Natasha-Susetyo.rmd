> There comes a time in every parent’s life when love must be expressed through buttercream, food dye, and sprinkles; I just didn’t know it would be so soon this time. Happy Birthday, my daughter! 

###Ingredients

* Cake
    + 1/2 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
    +2/3 cups (130 grams) granulated sugar
    + 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
    + 2 large egg whites
    + 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    + 1/2 cup (120 ml) buttermilk
    + 1 teaspoon baking powder
    + 2 tablespoons (16 grams) cornstarch
    + 1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour
    + 1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles

* Frosting
    + 1/2 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
    + 1 1/4 cups (150 grams) powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy
    + Pinch of fine salt
    + 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, plus more to taste
    + 1 tablespoon milk or cream
    + Rainbow sprinkles for decoration
    
###Tools
* Cake & Frosting
    + 8×8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan
    + parchment paper
    + mixer
    + rubber scraper
    + cooling rack

###Steps
1. *Preheat oven* : To 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of an 8×8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and coat the bottom and sides with nonstick spray or butter.

2. *Make cake* : Beat butter, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add egg whites, one at a time, beating until combined and slightly fluffy. Add vanilla and buttermilk and beat to combine. The mixture will instantly look like cottage cheese and you will be sure it’s ruined but I promise it is not. Add baking powder and cornstarch and beat very well to combine. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat one second more. Add flour and mix just until it disappears. Use a rubber scraper to gently fold in sprinkles.

3. *Bake cake* : Spread batter in prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. Let cool in pan on cooling rack for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the side to loosen the cake, flip it out onto the cooling rack, and slide the cooling rack into the freezer until cake is cool, about 10 to 15 minutes.

4. *Frost and serve* : While the cake cools, beat butter, sugar, salt and vanilla until fluffy, then add milk or cream and beat until smooth. Once cake is fully cool, transfer it to a serving plate. Spread frosting on top — you’ll have more than enough, so if you need to set some aside for small decorations or tinting and writing on the cake, this won’t be a problem. Finish with sprinkles. Share with friends.

###Other variations
* Confetti Sheet Cake
    + For the sheet cake version of this, triple the cake recipe and divide the batter between two 9×13-inch cake pans (mine were 935 grams of batter each). They bake for 18 to 20 minutes and yield two skinny cake layers that once frosted and filled make a 2-inch tall cake. I don’t know how to tell you this, I almost want to warn you to cover your ears, but if you want to fill and frost them the way I did, you’ll need to make five times the amount of frosting written. I actually made a 6x batch (1-pound boxes of powdered sugar hold 3 3/4 cups, so I used two in full), but it was too much (thank goodness). If your design is more elaborate, however, and you want more room for frosting error, just do the 6x. 
    
#**Mathematics Formula**

#Euclidean Distance

###Definition [[edit]]()
***

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment]() connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](), if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in [Euclidean *n*-space](), then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula]():

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}

d(\textbf{p,q}) = d(\textbf{q,p}) & = \ \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+\dotsb+(q_n-p_n)^2} \\
                                  &  = \ \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\begin{equation}  
\begin{split}

{\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt{p_{1}^2+p_{2}^2+\cdots +p_{n}^2}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }},} 

\end{split}
\end{equation}

where the last expression involves the [dot product]().
